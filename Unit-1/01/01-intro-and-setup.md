Before you move on to the next lesson, you should:

* Complete all exercises and SAVE EVERY EXERCISE FOR FUTURE USE
* Answer all questions in ONE MARKDOWN FILE

Be prepared to review your exercises with instructors and peers as well as engage in discussions about the questions.

Let's get started!

### What is Angular?

According to the official Angular introduction, Angular is a-

> client-side technology, written entirely in JavaScript. It works with the long-established technologies of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to make the development of web apps easier and faster than ever before.

Angular, along with other client-side libraries (Backbone, Ember, React), help us deal with larger, more complex code bases on the client-side. They also redefined the roles of the client and sever, resulting in a new application structure called a Single-Page Application (or SPA). In this new structure, the client interacts with the server by making RESTful AJAX requests that are triggered by user interactions.

It boils down to this: **Angular helps us build complex, single-page applications very quickly.**

### Hello, Angular!

We're going to start by setting up a very simple Angular app to say Hello World - Angular-style!

Staying true to an iterative approach to coding, we'll start slow, defining everything (markup and Angular syntax) within a single `index.html` file - a true single page app! - and scale from there, learning about patterns for structuring complicated Angular apps.

1. Create an `index.html` file.
1. Add the Angular dependency. For now, we're going to utilize a CDN - `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.5/angular.js`.
1. Add the `ng-app` attribute to the `<html>` element in your document. This indicates that *everything* inside of the `<html>` element - from the opening to closing tag - is part of an Angular app. In other words, all Angular code/tags that fall inside the `<html>` element will be rendered by the Angular interpreter. *Get used to that `ng` prefix as you will be seeing it A LOT!*
1. Test it out! Add the following Angular tag anywhere inside of the `<body>` tag - `<p>{{1 + 6}}<p>`. Open the page in your browser. If all is well then you should see `7`.
1. Finally, update the title element - `<title>{{ greeting }} World</title>` - and add the following two paragraphs:
  ```html
  <p>Say something to the world <input type="text" ng-model="greeting" ng-init="greeting='Hello, '"></p>
  <p>{{ greeting }} world!</p>
  ```

1. Test this out. Enter something in the input box and watch the DOM update! Note the new `ng-`attributes - you will learn more about them soon.

#### Final Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ greeting }} World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>{{1 + 6}}<p>
    <br>
    <p>Say something to the world <input type="text" ng-model="greeting" ng-init="greeting='Hello, '"></p>
    <p>{{ greeting }} world!</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.5/angular.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Questions

* Why learn Angular JS over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?
* People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?
* Is Angular an MVC framework?
* Turn to the Angular docs. Find `ng-app`. What is it and what does it do? What does `ng` stand for?
